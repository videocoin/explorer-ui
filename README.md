## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn`

Install and update dependencies

### `yarn start`

Start the application on port 3000

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Ui-kit
The videocoin projects share a ui library (cloud-ui-kit), which you can find here: https://github.com/videocoin/cloud-ui-kit.
Before starting the application you will need to install the ui-kit. From the project root run

### `git submodule update --init`
Now cd into src/ui-kit and run

### `yarn`
Once the submodules dependencies have finished installing you can cd back up to the top and run start the dev server.

### Usage

For a usage example look at the Logo component in Header.tsx. You can also look at the videocoin cloud ui (https://github.com/videocoin/cloud-ui)
, which uses the kit extensively.
